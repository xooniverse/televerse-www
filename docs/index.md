## What exactly is Televerse?

## How do I get started?

Building a simple bot is as simple as two steps. 

### 1. Get Televerse

Add `televerse` to your `pubspec.yaml` file by running `dart pub add televerse`.

  ```bash
  dart pub add televerse
  ```

### 2. Code your Bot

Get your bot ready in a few lines.

```dart [Dart]
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:televerse/televerse.dart';

// Create the bot instance
final bot = Bot(Platform.environment["BOT_TOKEN"]!);

void main(List<String> args) async {
  // Handle the /start command
  bot.command("start", (ctx) async {
    await ctx.reply("Welcome to Televerse! üöÄ");
  });

  // Start the bot
  await bot.start();
}
```

That's it, your bot should be running fine and listening to the `/start` command.
